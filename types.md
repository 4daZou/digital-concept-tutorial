## Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions on new data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms identify patterns in unlabeled data.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn through trial and error by receiving feedback from their actions.
