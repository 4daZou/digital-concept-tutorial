# Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning can be categorized into three types, each with unique characteristics and applications:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions on new data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms identify patterns in unlabeled data.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn through trial and error by receiving feedback from their actions.

## 1. Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from labeled training data
- **Goal**: Predict outcomes for new, unseen data
- **Example Algorithms**: 
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Neural Networks

### How It Works
- Input data comes with known output labels
- Algorithm learns to map inputs to correct outputs
- Used for prediction and classification tasks

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Discovering hidden patterns in unlabeled data
- **Goal**: Find inherent structures or groupings
- **Example Algorithms**:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis
  - Anomaly Detection

### How It Works
- No predefined labels or outcomes
- Finds natural groupings or relationships
- Used for exploratory data analysis

## 3. Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Learning through interaction and feedback
- **Goal**: Maximize cumulative reward
- **Example Algorithms**:
  - Q-Learning
  - Deep Q-Networks

### How It Works
- Agent learns by performing actions
- Receives rewards or penalties
- Develops optimal strategy through trial and error

## Choosing the Right Approach
- **Supervised**: When you have labeled data and a clear prediction goal
- **Unsupervised**: When exploring data patterns
- **Reinforcement**: For complex decision-making scenarios
