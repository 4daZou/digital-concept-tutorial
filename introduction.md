## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions without explicit programming. It involves creating algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and improve their performance over time.

## Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions on new data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms identify patterns in unlabeled data.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn through trial and error by receiving feedback from their actions.
