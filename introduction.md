## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions without explicit programming. It involves creating algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and improve their performance over time.

## Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions on new data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms identify patterns in unlabeled data.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn through trial and error by receiving feedback from their actions.

### Key Characteristics of Machine Learning

1. **Learns from Data**
   - Uses existing information to identify patterns
   - Improves performance over time
   - Adapts to new, unseen data

2. **Automatic Improvement**
   - Algorithms get better with more data
   - Reduces need for constant human intervention
   - Can handle complex, dynamic scenarios

## How Machine Learning Works: A Simple Analogy

Imagine teaching a child to recognize different types of fruit:
- **Traditional Programming**: Provide exact rules (color, shape, size)
- **Machine Learning**: Show multiple examples of fruits
  - Child learns to identify patterns
  - Can recognize new fruits not seen before

## Basic Machine Learning Process

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather relevant, quality data
   - More diverse data leads to better learning

2. **Model Training**
   - Feed data to ML algorithm
   - Algorithm discovers patterns
   - Creates a predictive model

3. **Prediction and Evaluation**
   - Test model on new data
   - Measure accuracy
   - Continuously refine the model
